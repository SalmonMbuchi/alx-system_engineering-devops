# 0x18-webstack_monitoring

In this project, I was introduced to the concept of monitoring. There are two types of monitoring:

- **Application monitoring** - is the monitoring and management of the performance and availability of software applications.

- **Server monitoring** - is the process of gaining visibility into the activity on your servers — whether physical or virtual.

I also got to work with *Datadog* which is a software monitoring tool.

**Tasks**

**2.Create a dashboard**
File: [2-setup_datadog](./2-setup_datadog)
Now create a dashboard with different metrics displayed in order to get a few different visualizations.

- Create a new dashboard
- Add at least 4 widgets to your dashboard. They can be of any type and monitor whatever you’d like
- Create the answer file 2-setup_datadog which has the dashboard_id on the first line. Note: in order to get the id of your dashboard, you may need to use Datadog’s API
