# Configuration Management

This is the process of systemically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time.

Automation plays an essential role in server configuration management. It is the mechanism used to make the server reach a desirable state, previously defined by provisioning scripts using a tool's specific language and features.

## Benefits of Configuration Management for Servers
The benefits include:

1. Quick provisioning of new servers
2. Quick recovery from critical events
3. Facilitates version control for the server environment
4. Replicated environments

In this particular project, I worked with Puppet, a popular configuration management tool. Puppet is capable of managing complex infrastructure in a transparent way using a master server to orchestrate the configuration of the nodes.
