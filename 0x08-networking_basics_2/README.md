# NETWORK BASICS

In this project, I learnt about the localhost,  /etc/hosts file, 0.0.0.0, and command line tools such as *nc*

## Tasks

Below are scripts written as part of the assignment for this project:
	1. **0-change_your_home_IP**: It configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements:
		a) localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
		b) facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8.
	2. **1-show_attached_IPs** : Displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it's executed on.
